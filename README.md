# The Odin Project: Landing Page

This is the second page from the Odin's project. The objective was to make a page utilizing a given design.
I decided to do it based on the space because there are a lot of cool pictures about it

The page is almost HTML/CSS only, there's just some Javascript to make the carousel works
